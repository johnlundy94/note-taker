# Note Taker

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to insure a place for anyone to go and create notes that the user can go back to.
If the user needs to take notes down for anything from class notes to reminders this app helps that problem.
In this project I learned how to create a beautiful front end design and incorporate a backend to store any note!
